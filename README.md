# Formula One Race Data Analysis and Driver Rank Prediction

## Basic Idea of Formula One?

Formula One, often referred to as F1, represents the pinnacle of international open-wheel single-seater formula racing, overseen by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Since its inaugural season in 1950, the FIA Formula One World Championship has held a preeminent position within the global racing landscape. The term "formula" within its nomenclature pertains to the comprehensive regulations that govern the design and performance parameters of all participating cars. Each Formula One season encompasses a series of races known as Grands Prix, which transpire across diverse countries and continents, occurring on bespoke circuits or temporarily closed public roads.

Having originated in 1950, Formula One racing boasts a distinguished heritage as one of the most enduring motorsport events. Its widespread popularity positions it among the foremost sports worldwide. The sport's activities yield an extensive corpus of data, meticulously gathered through sensors integrated within the vehicles during practice, qualifying, and the ultimate race sessions.

## Purpose of the Project


The utilization of big data analytics affords Formula 1 teams a distinct competitive advantage by facilitating prompt and effective data-driven decision-making processes, ultimately culminating in enhanced race outcomes.

Our research endeavors to undertake a comprehensive analysis of historical data with the objective of discerning the performance of drivers, employing an array of statistical metrics. These metrics encompass diverse facets such as the frequency of pit stops, race completion times, point accrual, attainment of podium positions, and other pertinent variables. This meticulous examination will not only furnish valuable insights into driver performance but also lay the foundation for prognosticating forthcoming race results based on antecedent performances.
