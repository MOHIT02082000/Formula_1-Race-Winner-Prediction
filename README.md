## Basic Idea of Formula One?

Formula One, often referred to as F1, represents the pinnacle of international open-wheel single-seater formula racing, overseen by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

The term "formula" within its nomenclature pertains to the comprehensive regulations that govern the design and performance parameters of all participating cars. Each Formula One season encompasses a series of races known as Grands Prix, which transpire across diverse countries and continents, occurring on bespoke circuits or temporarily closed public roads.

Having originated in 1950, Formula One racing boasts a distinguished heritage as one of the most enduring motorsport events. Its widespread popularity positions it among the foremost sports worldwide. The sport's activities yield an extensive corpus of data, meticulously gathered through sensors integrated within the vehicles during practice, qualifying, and the ultimate race sessions.
